# Daily Progress Notes

## AI
**혼공머신**
- 05-3: Gradient Boosting

## Japanese
**JLPT N3(Hackers)**
- vocabulary
- listening practice

## Today's Wins
- I've been tired today. It's not physical but mental. But I studied all subjects. 
- I can now skip what I can't perfectly memorize(Japanese vocabulary) or understand(machine learning). Especially for vocabulary, I've made a kind of skip rule. 
- I also use transfer learning from time to time when I study machine learning, but It's less frequently than before.   

## Tomorrow's Plan
- **AI**: 05-3: Histogram-based Gradient Boosting
- **Japanese**: Memorizing words using app and solving textbook
