## What I Learned

### 1. Development Environment
- **IDE (Integrated Development Environment)**: Code editor + tools in one place
- **Computational Notebook**: Interactive coding environment (`.ipynb` files)
- **Kernel**: Engine that actually runs code (ipykernel for Python)

### 2. VS Code Setup
- Installed Python extension
- Created `.ipynb` file → prompted to install ipykernel
- Kernel = bridge between code and Python interpreter

### 3. Git & GitHub
- **Git**: Version control on local machine
- **GitHub**: Remote storage for Git repositories

```bash
# Initial config (one-time setup)
git config --global user.name "YourName"
git config --global user.email "your@email.com"

# Verify config
git config user.name
git config user.email
```

## Deep Dive: Concepts I Explored

### SSH vs SSL
| | SSH | SSL |
|---|---|---|
| Purpose | Authentication + encryption | Data encryption in transit |
| In Git | `git@github.com:...` URLs | `https://github.com/...` URLs |
| Analogy | Private key to enter a tunnel | Locked package during delivery |

### Terminal Options in VS Code
| Terminal | Best for |
|----------|----------|
| Command Prompt | Legacy Windows |
| PowerShell | Windows power users |
| **Git Bash** | Cross-platform, Linux commands ✓ |

→ Recommended: **Git Bash** (uses `ls`, `clear` like Mac/Linux)

### What is a Kernel?
- **OS Kernel**: Core that talks to hardware
- **Jupyter Kernel**: Engine that executes code cells

Both = "the core that does the real work"

## Key Takeaways

1. `config` = configuration = settings
2. Git Bash uses Linux commands → better for learning
3. Kernel appears in different contexts but always means "core engine"
