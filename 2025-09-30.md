## Today's Wins
- I cut English study time to focus on Japanese study. I followed my study mate's advice. Then I could manage stress relatively well.
- I signed up for speaking class. Honestly, I've experienced failures before but I never give up.
- I reviewed regularization thoroughly. I believe I learned better than the previous week.
