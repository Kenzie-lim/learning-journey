## Today's Wins
- It's been a long time since I studied. Like many habits are annoying to start for the first time, my condition was seriously like that, but I started. 
- After spending 1hour I could feel studying is fun and exciting. 
- I've been bothered for 2 weeks because of family affairs. And today also it happend, but I could get back to my study unlike in the past. 
- I skipped detailed concepts if I felt I needed to come back here later. I think I accepted that I can't study perfectly.
