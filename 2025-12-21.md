## Statqueset : 4.Linear Regression

- R² (Effect Size): "How much does my model explain?" (magnitude)
- p-value (Confidence): "Is this effect real or random?" (existence)

Both evaluate same regression result from different angles

**Mathematical Connection**
```
R² → F-statistic → p-value
      ↑
  Sample size (n)
```

**Key Insight**
p-value = Meta-framework that applies to many tests
