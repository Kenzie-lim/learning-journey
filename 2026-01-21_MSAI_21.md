## Overview

### Context
This lab bridges Azure cloud infrastructure (VM, ML Compute, Blob Storage) with creative AI applications. It builds on yesterday's Stable Diffusion WebUI setup and extends into real-world deployment scenarios: automated file sync, WordPress integration, and product conceptualization for cultural AI.

### Objective
Complete a full POC cycle: from infrastructure automation to deploying a functional demo product inspired by Sakana AI's cultural positioning strategy.

## Lab Flow

**1. File Sync Automation (Azure Blob + azcopy + watchdog)**
- What: Set up shell script for uploading SD outputs to Azure Blob Storage, then implemented watchdog for real-time monitoring
- **Why**: Manual file transfer doesn't scale; production workflows need automated pipelines
- **So what**: Understanding the gap between "manual execution" and "true automation" — watchdog bridges this by triggering uploads on file system events

**2. Sakana AI Research & Cultural AI Positioning**
- What: Investigated Sakana AI's ukiyo-e models (24,000 images, LoRA fine-tuning on SDXL) and their $2.65B valuation strategy
- **Why**: Contextualizes why cultural specialization matters — it's not just technical, it's brand differentiation
- **So what**: A Korean equivalent (chaekgado) could follow the same playbook: public domain assets + cultural narrative + AI generation

**3. Chaekgado Project Conceptualization**
- What: Designed "chaekgado-AI" — Instagram-ready book record service using traditional Korean bookshelf paintings
- **Why**: PMF thinking: targeting book lovers who want aesthetic reading records, leveraging chaekgado's unique properties (horizontal tiling, copyright-free)
- **So what**: Product vision crystallized: 2-image sets (chaekgado front + quote card back) creating "infinite bookshelf" effect on Instagram feed

**4. POC Development & Deployment**
- What: Built two Netlify apps (quote card generator + chaekgado demo), embedded into WordPress on Azure VM
- **Why**: Functional demo beats slide decks — proves concept works even without full automation
- **So what**: Complete demo environment ready: landing page, image galleries, interactive generators — all deployed and accessible

**5. Prompt Engineering for Chaekgado Style**
- What: Tested FLUX with detailed prompts for Korean traditional bookshelf aesthetic (square format, two-shelf composition, seamless edges)
- **Why**: No dedicated chaekgado LoRA exists; prompt engineering is the accessible starting point
- **So what**: validates need for actual dataset + LoRA fine-tuning in next phase

## Key Insight

The real learning wasn't Stable Diffusion or WordPress — it was seeing a full product cycle compressed into one day: research (Sakana AI) → concept (cultural AI positioning) → design (PMF for book lovers) → build (generators) → deploy (Netlify + WordPress). Technical tools are just enablers; the value is in connecting them to a coherent product vision.

## Deep Dive

- **watchdog vs cron**: watchdog reacts to file system events in real-time; cron runs on schedule regardless of changes. For SD output sync, watchdog is more responsive but requires persistent process.
- **Cultural AI as brand strategy**: Sakana AI's ukiyo-e models aren't their core revenue driver — they're proof-of-concept for evolutionary model merging AND brand positioning as "Japanese culture AI." Technical capability + cultural narrative = differentiation.
- **LoRA fine-tuning gap**: Prompt engineering alone can't capture chaekgado's specific aesthetic (ink texture, perspective, object arrangement). Next step requires actual dataset collection and LoRA training.
