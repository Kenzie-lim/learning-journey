# Daily Progress Notes

## AI
- **Goal is same**: Find weights w in linear equation 

- **3 Different approaches**:
  - LinearRegression: Math formula, 1 time calculation (no epoch)
  - LogisticRegression: Batch GD, uses all data repeatedly (has epochs)
  - SGDClassifier: Stochastic GD, uses 1 sample at a time (has iterations)

- **Key Insight**:
SGD's max_iter is NOT epochs - it's number of individual iterations!
LogisticRegression also repeats multiple times (not just once)
