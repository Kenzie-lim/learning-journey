# Daily Progress Notes

## AI
**Today's Concepts**
- SGDClassifier: Sample one-by-one training (stochastic = random sampling)
- Batch vs SGD vs Mini-batch: Memory/speed tradeoff
- Cross-validation: Only for evaluation, doesn't change model weights
- Sigmoid vs Softmax: Binary (2-class) vs Multi-class activation
- Keras Sequential API: Requires list format in latest versions

**Key Insight**
Mathematical functions embed worldviews: sigmoid assumes binary division (p/(1-p)), softmax assumes multi-party competition (e^z_i/Σe^z_j)
