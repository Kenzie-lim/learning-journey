## What I Learned

### 1. For Loop: Value vs Index
- `for i in list:` → `i` is the **value**, not index
- If you need index: use `for i in range(len(list)):`
- Common mistake: using `list[i]` when `i` is already the value

### 2. Key Built-in Functions

| Function | Behavior | Returns |
|----------|----------|---------|
| `split()` | Splits string by delimiter | New list (original unchanged) |
| `sort()` | Sorts in place | None |
| `sorted()` | Creates sorted copy | New list |
| `range()` | Generates sequence | Only accepts **integers** |

### 3. `*args` and `map()`
- `*args` receives arguments as a **tuple**
- `map(func, iterable)` applies func to **each element individually**
- Don't use map with a function that already iterates internally

### 4. Lambda
- Anonymous, one-line function
- Can be used anywhere, but most common with `map`, `filter`, `sorted`
- Example: `lambda x: x * 2`

## Problems I Hit

| Problem | Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------|----------|
| `list()` not working | Used `list` as variable name | `del list` to restore |
| `print()` not callable | Used `print` as variable name | `del print` to restore |
| `range(args)` TypeError | `range()` needs int, got tuple | Use `for i in args:` directly |
| `split()` not changing string | `split()` returns new list | Assign result: `t_list = t.split()` |

## Deep Dive

### Step-by-Step Coding Approach
1. **Input/Output**: Write down what goes in, what comes out
2. **Hand trace**: Solve like a "constrained person" (one item at a time, no full view)
3. **List tools needed**: for, if, variables, lists
4. **Write code**: Assemble the pieces
5. **Edge cases**: Empty list? Single element?

### Vocabulary vs Combination
- Feeling stuck ≠ missing syntax knowledge
- Usually = lack of **combination practice**
- `for`, `if`, variables, lists → these 4 solve almost everything
- "I need to learn more" is often avoidance of practice

### Reading Error Messages
- Read from **bottom up**
- Last line = what went wrong (e.g., `TypeError: 'tuple' object cannot be interpreted as an integer`)
- Lines above = where it happened
- These two pieces solve most debugging

## Key Takeaways

1. **"Constrained person" mental model**: Think like someone who can only see one card at a time
2. **Question → Answer → Code**: Don't jump straight to coding
3. **Combination > Vocabulary**: Practice assembling known pieces, not hunting for new syntax
4. **Built-in names are reserved**: Never use `list`, `dict`, `print`, `str` as variable names
5. **Error messages are your friend**: Read bottom-up, find the line + the reason

## Next Steps

- [ ] Practice for/if combination with simple problems daily
- [ ] Before coding: write Input/Output and hand-trace the logic
- [ ] When stuck: resist "there must be a function I don't know" thinking
- [ ] Read error messages carefully before asking for help
