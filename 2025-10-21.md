# Daily Progress Notes

## AI
**혼공머신**
- 04-2: Stochastic Gradient Descent
- 05-1: decision tree

## Japanese
**JLPT N4(Hackers)**
- All clear listening chapter

## Today's Wins
- I just went through the decision tree chapter, even though I knew that I didn't understand it perfectly. I just noted like below, then skipped that part : I noticed in the stochastic gradient descent algorithm, we can choose various loss functions as option parameters. There are some kinds other than log loss function (even I didn't understand it), and hinge algorithm for support vector machine.

- I tired to check terminologies in English. For example, 'stochastic gradient descent' was a difficult term for me, I tried repeatedly to memorize tir. 

- I wasn't in a hurry and got all things I wanted to achieve. It was possible because I adjusted my goals realistically. 

## Tomorrow's Plan
- **AI**: 05-1: decision tree
- **Japanese**: Memorizing words using app and solving textbook
