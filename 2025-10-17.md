**혼공머신**

## Japanese

## Today's Wins
- Still slowly coming back to routine. I completed 80% of what I usually achieve
- I heard heartbreaking news today, but I tried to complete what I should do
- I noticed that I got stuck on several concepts because I felt that I don't understand them perfectly. I consulted with AI and it returned some methods to break out. I think just discussing with AI could be one method to escape perfectionism. 

## Tomorrow's Plan
I need to do every subject even if I can't finish all of them in each area. 
- AI : Just start 04-2 chapter
- English : memorizing words using app.
- Japanese : memorizing words using app and solving text book.
- Math : listening lesson and reading book 30 min
